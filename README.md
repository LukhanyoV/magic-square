# Magic Square

Trying to learn Vue, that's how I ended up with making this game

## Rules are simple: 
* green squares give you 1 point
* blue squares take away 1 point
* black squares don't do anything you can press them when you see a blue square

## Things to add:
* work on the game design (currently working on)
* time given to pick a square / time taken for the game to auto end
* save to score board (optional)
